# Hi, I'm Alex

I spent a decade debugging aircraft networks and satellite telemetry.

Now I'm shipping products that automate the boring stuff (so that you don't have to).

Focused on automation, analytics and productivity solutions that add genuine value.

Building in public, sharing every mistake and breakthrough.

### Projects

I write clean, reliable code because systems that fail in aerospace don't get second chances. The same principles apply to software that people depend on.

-   [Skyflow](https://skyflow.me) - Free Bluesky analytics (1000+ users)
-   [Password Please!](https://pwplz.com) - Security tools with 500+ daily generations
-   [PunPal](https://punpal.net) - Built and deployed in 24 hours

### Stack

Server code varies between [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi), [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), [Django](https://github.com/django/django) and [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).

NoSQL fanboy, primarily working with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

All client interfaces built with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/).

All deployments on [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/vercel). All domains managed with [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/).

Most of my code is consulted by Claude. None of it is written by Cursor.
