# Hi, I'm Alex

I spent a decade debugging aircraft networks and satellite telemetry.

Now I'm shipping products that automate the boring stuff (so that you don't have to). Solving automation, analytics and productivity headaches I've encountered over the years.

Sharing every mistake and breakthrough. Prioritising value over revenue.

**Recent projects:**

-   [Skyflow](https://skyflow.me) - Free Bluesky analytics (1000+ users)
-   [Password Please!](https://pwplz.com) - Security tools with 500+ daily generations
-   [PunPal](https://punpal.net) - Built and deployed in 24 hours

I write clean, reliable code because systems that fail in aerospace don't get second chances. The same principles apply to software that people depend on.

My user interfaces are built with Next.js and the backends vary between FastAPI, Gin, Django and Axum.
